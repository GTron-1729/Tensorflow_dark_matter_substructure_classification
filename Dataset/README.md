# This is a dataset of blackhole images along with the nature of bending light around them.

The images are generated using Pyautolens. Reference to the notebooks for examples of how to simulate strong gravitational
lensing with PyAutoLens can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IhgY91XCXz1QF5GoZow8Hu-YvzWbPZP6/view?usp=s).

# Description

A set of simulated strong gravitational lensing images with and without Dark Matter substructure.
Using a deep learning algorithm of our choice we have to learn the representation of dark
matter in the strong gravitational lensing images provided using PyTorch/Tensorflow.
The goal is to use this learned representation for anomaly detection.

When completed, please send your solutions including jupyter notebooks
and code to taroneganesh@gmail.com. You are free to do pull requests on the repo. Looking forward to do this üëç
